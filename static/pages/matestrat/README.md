# Code to simulate agonistic behaviour in animals

This repository contains the code for a Javascript simulation to try to understand why male animals that fight for female mates don't usually kill each other. It was inspired by watching a National Geographic program showing male king cobras trying to pin each other down but not attempting to bite each other. The same behaviour is apparently seen in [male black mambas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour#Example:_Black_mamba_.28Dendroaspis_polylepis.29).

It's implemented at this website: http://nathangeffen.webfactional.com/matestrat/matestrat.html
