Towards the end of 2009, a renowned tuberculosis doctor at one of Cape Town's large public hospitals told me a terrible story.

He had started treating a woman with extensively drug-resistant TB. (I will call her Sindi.)

Her strain of TB has an extremely high fatality rate. To have a reasonable chance of surviving, patients often have to take medicines for two years. These medicines have nasty side-effects, but they are often life-saving.

Nevertheless, after taking her prescribed medicines, Sindi began to recover and do well. Then she stopped taking them. The doctor discovered that Sindi had joined a church called Christ Embassy run by the charismatic but controversial Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.

The church's main attraction is its healing school, in which it claims that Pastor Chris faith-heals people. He is referred to as "the man of God".

Apparently Sindi had come to believe she had been healed and stopped taking her medicines. Her health deteriorated and she soon died. But, tragically, before dying she transmitted extensively drug-resistant TB to her two children.

On November 22, 2009, e.tv ran a long advert by Christ Embassy. It showed a young woman with heart disease allegedly being cured when Pastor Chris laid hands on her. Variations of this advert ran every week on e.tv. Christ Embassy paid R2.6-million for a year's worth of ads. After hearing Sindi's story and seeing this advert, I lodged a complaint against Christ Embassy, on behalf of the Treatment Action Campaign, at the Advertising Standards Authority.

The authority initially dismissed my complaint, claiming it was a programme and not an advert, but I appealed and won; the advert was ordered to be withdrawn. Then Christ Embassy appealed and consequently the Final Appeal Committee of the ASA ruled that the advert be withdrawn.

The complaint raised difficult questions about what precisely constitutes an advert and whether our Constitution's guarantees of religious freedom gave Christ Embassy the right to make faith-healing claims.

Christ Embassy's lawyers argued that the programme they ran on e.tv was spreading the word of God and espousing their faith, which includes belief in faith-healing. Quite correctly, the Final Appeal Committee of the ASA didn't agree.

The Committee, headed by Judge Mervyn King, explained that Constitutional rights have to be balanced against each other and decisions must sometimes limit one right in connection with another, so long as those limitations are reasonable and justifiable. Their ruling went to great pains to explain that they were not infringing Christ Embassy's religious rights.

The committee wrote: "We expressly record that this ruling in no way impinges on or is intended to restrict [Christ Embassy's] right to entertain its religious beliefs, to announce its religious beliefs or to manifest such beliefs by worship or practice."

The ruling also explains that the Advertising Code is a contract between advertisers and their audience. By placing an advert on e.tv, Christ Embassy has entered a contract and must therefore abide by the provisions of the Advertising Code. That code prohibits claims that cannot be substantiated. It also prohibits advertising a product to treat various diseases, including heart disease, unless the product is registered with the Medicines Control Council to treat the disease in question.

Christ Embassy had numerous opportunities to substantiate their faith-healing claims, but could not do so because faith-healing is simply not plausible. There is no evidence that the laying of hands or faith is any more effective at treating illness than a placebo, or sugar pill. Pastor Chris is essentially running a business based on a false premise. Whether or not he believes this is irrelevant.

For the most part e.tv has escaped criticism during this affair. But they must share responsibility for these unethical adverts. The station is aware of the ASA code. It has been outspoken against other forms of dangerous medical advice, like Aids denialism. I alerted e.tv to the problems with the advert, but it refused to withdraw it until the ASA decision was made. This was unacceptable.

Media companies have agreed to abide by the Advertising Code. They should make an effort to ensure the adverts they run do not contravene the code; they should avoid ASA complaints, not merely implement them. Sadly, the temptation of large ad deals outweighs the broadcaster's commitment to truthful advertising.
