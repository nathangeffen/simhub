<p>30 June 2008</p>
<h3 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h3>
<p>We are South Africans who have struggled for human rights, both before and after the fall of Apartheid. We have sought to institute and defend the values of our new Constitution: freedom, equality and human dignity. We are committed to personal and public integrity and to the governance principles of transparency, accountability and openness.</p>
<p>We believe that human rights are interconnected and indivisible. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We know that global stability is important for all of our prosperity. Similarly, we are committed to upholding international law and human rights.</p>
<p>We believe that Israelis and Palestinians have the right to security, sovereignty, and self-determination within the framework of justice, international law, and human rights.</p>
<p>We undertake this mission to Palestine/Israel for a few modest purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We want to support those, Palestinian and Israeli, working daily, by non-violent means, to bring an end to the post-1967 Israeli occupation, to end all human rights abuses and breaches of international law, and to move towards peaceful relations and a just settlement. We hope to share with them our similar and different experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to express solidarity with those who are living in oppressive, restrictive and dangerous circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to convey with compassion our sympathy for those Palestinian and Israeli individuals, families and communities who have suffered loss of life.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to draw attention to the injustice of the occupation and its devastating consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to push forward a rational public discussion that responds to the situation on the basis of universal human rights.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="details-of-trip">Details of Trip</h3>
<h3 id="who-is-hosting-the-delegation">Who is hosting the delegation?</h3>
<p>The South African Human Rights Delegation delegation will be hosted by the Joint Struggle Coalition, a new coalition of organizations, activists and local popular committees dedicated to the joint Palestinian-Israeli non-violent struggle against the Occupation. This coalition includes: The Popular Committee of Budrus, the Popular Committee of Bidu, the Popular Committee of Bil’in, The Popular Committee of Na’alin, ACRI (Association for Civil Rights in Israel), Adalah, Yesh Din, Combatants for Peace, Breaking the Silence, Ta’ayush, and other organizations.</p>
<h3 id="where-will-the-delegation-be-and-what-will-it-be-doing">Where will the delegation be and what will it be doing?</h3>
<p>Based in East Jerusalem, the delegation will hear lectures by leading scholars, on Israel and Palestine, and the history and effects of the post-1967 occupation. Each day will be devoted to studying different aspects of the occupation, and its context. These will range from the construction of the Fence/Wall and the struggles against it, political violence and its costs, the “policy of separation” implemented in Hebron, the continued expansion of settlements in and splintering of East Jerusalem, the issue of Palestinian political prisoners and its effects on Palestinian society, and restrictions on movement, livelihood and rights. Meetings will also take place in cities such as Nablus and East Jerusalem, as well as the refugee camps in the area. Significant time will also be spent in Israel to better understand the complexities and sentiments bearing on the political situation. Thus the delegation will visit the Holocaust memorial museum Yad Vashem, guided by an expert historian of the Holocaust, will visit the Supreme Court to engage with the Chief Justice, and will hear from both Israelis and Palestinians who have lost family members in the conflict. There will be a strong focus on the legal issues, and thus top Palestinian and Israeli human rights lawyers will accompany the group.</p>

<p><strong>Zackie Achmat</strong> has been called the most important South African dissident since Nelson Mandela. He began his political career at age 14, as an anti-apartheid organizer, and was later the leader of South Africa’s gay rights movement, one of the most successful in the world. He is most widely known as the founder and chairman of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a grassroots movement that works to secure AIDS treatment and prevention for all South Africans. When he pledged not to take antiretroviral medicines until all South Africans could obtain them, Nelson Mandela pleaded with him, at his home, to begin drug therapy. Achmat respectfully refused Mandela, and held firm in his pledge until August 2003 when a national congress of TAC activists voted to urge him to begin taking his medicines; shortly before the government announced that it would make antiretroviral drugs available to the public. For his political leadership, Achmat won the inaugural Desmond Tutu Leadership Award, the Jonathan Mann Award for Global Health and Human Rights in 2003, and the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights in 2003. He was named one of TIMEeurope’s “Heroes of 2003”, and was voted in the Top 100 Great South Africans, as well as being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Berger</strong> is head of policy and research at the AIDS Law Project.

He holds degrees in architecture and law from the University of the Witwatersrand, as well as a Master of Laws degree from the University of Toronto. Until late 2007, Jonathan chaired the board of the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project. He was integrally involved in the successful Constitutional Court challenge to the exclusion of same-sex couples from the marriage laws of South Africa. He also participated in lobbying and advocacy leading to the adoption of the Civil Union Act, 2006. He publishes widely on health, human rights, social justice litigation strategy, and the use and limits of law in social struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Geoff Budlender</strong> is a practising advocate (barrister). In his student days he was acting President of the anti-apartheid National Union of South African Students. He then worked for three years as a lawyer mainly in representing people charged with political offences against apartheid.

He fought cases involving forced removal of Africans from their land, the influx control laws which prevented free movement of Africans, and detention without trial. &gt;From 1996-2000 he was Director-General of the Department of Land Affairs in the new democratic government. He then returned to the Legal Resources Centre to undertake constitutional litigation. He is now in private practice as an advocate. He regularly appears in the Constitutional Court. He has taken on cases dealing with the death penalty, land rights, housing rights, social welfare rights, and the state’s duty to provide medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV at birth. He has served as an acting judge of the High Court.</p>

<p><strong>John Copelyn</strong>, a former Member of Parliament for ANC, heads the Investment Group for South Africa’s biggest labor union in the textile and clothing industry (Sactwu), with over 100,000 members. Under his management, Sactwu Investment Group has developed a capital base of R4 billion from an initial investment of R2 million. The capital provides university bursaries to all children of its members, a full welfare program for members, and a substantial HIV AIDS program covering worker education, testing and counseling, home care, and ARV treatment. In a twenty year career as a trade union leader Copelyn negotiated the first agreement recognizing an unregistered non-racial union; negotiated the merger of several union groups into South Africa’s giant broad-based federation COSATU; drafted the constitution for COSATU; served on COSATU’s central and national executive committees; and negotiated the National Peace Accord, a non-violent process to regulate disputes between political groups.

<p><strong>Barbara Hogan</strong> grew up in Benoni, an industrial town. She was the first woman to be elected as a Junior Deputy-Mayor in South Africa. Arrested for the first time in anti-government protests at the age of 18, she became a student activist and joined the embryonic black trade union movement that was later to emerge as COSATU, the largest trade union federation in South Africa. In 1977, Barbara joined the banned, underground political wing of the African National Congress (ANC). In 1981 she was arrested and sentenced to an effective 10 years imprisonment for High Treason for so-called political offences. Her release came in 1990, one week after the unbanning of the ANC.

<p><strong>Doron Isaacs</strong> is the Coordinator of Equal Education, a community-based civil society formation working for educational quality and equality in South African schools. Equal Education recognises that education was a tool to both entrench apartheid, and to resist it, and that present-day transformation in South Africa requires equal education for all. Doron has degrees from the University of Cape Town in business and law. In 2003 he was Secretary General of Habonim, a Jewish youth movement committed to a progressive Jewish identity, and to a just resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Thereafter he became active in student politics on issues including HIV-AIDS, judicial independence and Israel-Palestine.

These include the Muslim Views Achiever Award as well as the Honor Medal for Distinguished Service to Journalism from the University of Missouri. She is also the first woman in Africa to have won the coveted foreign journalist award from the National Association of Black Journalists in the USA. Ms Jaffer is also known for her community activism which earned her at least two spells in apartheid South Africa’s notorious detention centres. Her memoir, Our Generation, eloquently tells the story of her emotional journey through the years of South Africa’s turbulence into a new democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Jody Kollapen</strong> is the Chairperson of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), a constitutional body set up in terms of Chapter 9 of the South African Constitution to protect and promote human rights. He was appointed by President Mandela on the recommendation of Parliament and reappointed for a second term by President Mbeki. President Mandela also appointed him to interview and make recommendations on persons to be appointed to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Between 1981 and 1992 he practiced law in Pretoria, during which time he represented persons prosecuted under apartheid laws. He served as the National Director of Lawyers for Human Rights from 1994 until 1995. His areas of interest include human rights within the administration of justice, equality, and socio-economic rights. He currently serves on various national and international human rights bodies, including the Legal Resources Centre and the Foundation for Human Rights.

In the earlier part of this period she was directly involved in drafting the new Constitution, as a member of the Constitutional Assembly’s Constitutional Committee. In 1993 and1994 she served as Deputy Executive Director of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC), the body responsible for handling the transition to democracy. In this capacity she was responsible for six sectors: finance, defence, intelligence, policing, foreign affairs and local government. From 1991-1994 she was part of the ANC negotiating team, and the management team of CODESA, the body that oversaw the negotiations. This process included the demobilization of armed forces, as well as the creation of transitional arrangements to create an appropriate climate for South Africa’s first democratic elections. From 1987-1991 Janet was a member of the ANC underground: she was part of “President’s Project” which included Operation Vulindlela. In 1999 she was awarded a twenty year service medal by Umkhonto weSizwe.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Lewis</strong> was born in Cape Town in 1955. In 1976 he was banned for five years in by the apartheid government while still a student at Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape. In the 1980s he was politically active in the anti-apartheid movement. He initiated NGOs providing community health services and educational support to school students and post-school vocational training to young adult school leavers. He completed a Ph.D in economic history in 1983. From 1985 to 1993 he lectured on political economy. In 1993 he formed Idol Pictures where he continued his exploration of historical and contemporary issues in development, education and culture for a mass television audience. In 1999 he established Community Health Media Trust – a not-for-profit company which produces Siyayinqoba Beat It! – which provides a platform for people with HIV and those affected by the epidemic, to make their voices heard on television. The 7th edition of this series is currently in production. Jack believes that television has a vital role to play in the construction of a thinking, critical civil society voice in African democracies.</p>
<p><strong>Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge</strong> was dismissed from her position as Deputy Minister of Health by President Mbeki in August 2007. This made world headlines. Nozizwe had been the only member of Mbeki’s cabinet to publicly question his denialist views on HIV/AIDS, to champion the scientific governance of medicine, to speak candidly on the poor state of health in the country, and to call for treatment for all South Africans suffering with AIDS. She was the only member of cabinet awarded an A+++ rating by the Mail &amp; Guardian in its annual ministerial review. The backlash against her dismissal indicated the esteem with which she was held by the South African public, and hastened the decline of Mbeki’s prestige in the ANC. Previously she served as Deputy Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2004. She remains an ANC member of Parliament, and has recently been Acting Chair of Caucus. She has also recently been elected a member of the party’s NEC, its highest body. She was a member of the ANC underground from 1979. She has a long-standing record of supporting the rights of women. She served on the Transitional Executive Council and the Reconstruction and Development Task Team in positions relating to the status of women. She is Second vice-president of the Co-ordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians, a body affiliated to the Interparliamentary Union. She has studied at the universities of Natal, Fort Hare and Cape Town. She is married to Jeremy and has two sons, Martin and Simon. She is a member of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).</p>
<p><strong>Thabo Makgoba</strong> is the Most Revered Archbishop of Cape Town and Metropolitan of the Anglican Church. He is therefore the head of the Southern African Anglican Church, which has around four million members in six Southern African countries. At 47 he was the youngest person to be elected Archbishop, the position previously held by Desmond Tutu and Njongonkulu Ndungane. The Archbishop holds a Masters degree in Educational Psychology and has an interest in theological education, rural development and maternal and infant deaths. He has recently spoken out on the situation in Zimbabwe, calling for a UN arms embargo, and against the xenophobic violence in Cape Town. He grew up in Alexandra Township, Johannesburg, and today lives with his wife Lungi and their son Nyakallo and daughter Paballo in Bishopscourt.</p>
<p><strong>Mondli Makhanya</strong> is the Editor of the Sunday Times. He was previously Editor of the Mail &amp; Guardian. A regular commentator on the BBC, SAfm, Radio 702 and television current affairs programs, he started his career in journalism at the old Weekly Mail in 1990 where he was the paper’s Cape Town bureau chief and a business writer. Makhanya also interned at Newsweek magazine in New York. In addition, he was a political writer and Deputy News Editor of The Star and Associate Editor of Sunday World. Makhanya is on the national council of the SA National Editors’ Forum.</p>

A founder member of the Durban Conscientious Objector Support Group, the End Conscription Campaign, the National Education Crisis Committee, and the nonracial teachers Union NUESA, he was detained during the state of emergency. In 2004 and 2007 he spent periods of 3 months in Palestine – Sawarheh and Jayyous – with the World Council of Churches Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme, monitoring the occupation, the separation barrier and checkpoints. He also facilitated Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP) workshops for both Palestinians and Israelis. A chemical engineer by training, Jeremy managed the Science Education Project training black science teachers and taught at the nonracial Uthongathi School. After the democratic elections he managed the Quaker Peace Centre and now coordinates the activities of Phaphama Initiatives providing AVP training for refugees and inmates at Pollsmoor prison. In addition, he is launching a training programme to train Gender Reconciliation facilitators.</p>
<p><strong>Jonny Steinberg</strong> is the author of several books about everyday life in the wake of South Africa’s transition to democracy. Two of them, Midlands (2002), about the murder of a white farmer, and The Number (2004), about a Cape Town prison gangster, won South Africa’s premier nonfiction literary award, the Sunday Times Alan Paton Prize. His latest book, Three-Letter Plague, documents the arrival of antiretroviral medicine in a rural town at the heart of South Africa’s AIDS pandemic. Steinberg wrote a newspaper column for six years on the leader page of Business Day, a national financial daily. His journalism is collected in Notes from a Fractured Country (2007). He was educated at Wits University in Johannesburg, and at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.

<h2 id="post-mission-statement-sa-human-rights-delegation-to-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories">Post-mission statement: SA Human Rights Delegation to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories</h2>
<p>Concluding Statement</p>
<p>We are 23 South Africans from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>The primary intention of our visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories was to understand the reality. Rather than attempting to bring solutions, or to spend our time here debating solutions, we came to learn, and to witness first-hand the suffering, pain, anger and human rights abuses. While it is clear to us that there should be freedom and security for all who live here, our deepest concern is that suffering and human rights be addressed as the basis for moving towards a resolution. We have been deeply affected by what we have seen, and intend to engage in this regard, in our personal capacities, with all our communities and constituencies. We intend to be sensitive to the anxieties and perspectives that exist, and to use our visit to promote thoughtful discussion within and between our communities.</p>
<p>We also came to support what we understood to be a new and small movement of Palestinian-Israeli joint non-violent struggle. We found this, and it surprised us. Our hosts have proved that Israelis and Palestinians can and are working together to bring freedom and equality for all people in Israel and Palestine. This work is characterised by mutual respect, true partnership, and a willingness to take personal risks for each other. We are immensely struck and moved by the courage and integrity of these people. Amidst the increasing difficulties under which all people are living, this work brings hope and the promise of a real peace, with justice, equality and security, in the future.</p>
<p>We would particularly like to recognise the joint work being done in occupied territory in Silwan, Bidu, Bil’in, Budrus, Na’alin and Hebron. This work is being done by the popular committees of these villages and cities, along with organisations including Ta’ayush, Children of Abraham, Anarchists Against the Wall, Combatants for Peace, Breaking the Silence, Active Stills, the Parents Circle, B’Tselem, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Coalition of Women for Peace, and Yesh Din.</p>

<p>2 September 2008 (date the letter was sent)</p>
<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p>Ze-ev Krein blames Doron Isaacs for what he believes are the shortcomings of the Human Rights Delegation to Israel and the West Bank. He suggests that Isaacs has manipulated and duped 22 people with substantial records of campaigning for human rights. Krein’s suggestion is silly. None of us is naïve or gullible enough to fall prey to the far-fetched scheme Krein alleges. We joined the tour knowing its agenda and cognisant of its implications. We are all individuals with differently nuanced views about the conflict - though we all share a belief that human rights should be respected.</p>
<p>But it is Krein’s claim that we are ‘anti-Israel’ that is most misconceived. We are neither anti-Israel nor pro-Palestinian. We do not seek the destruction of the state of Israel. We seek peace on just terms. We participated in the tour to lend support to principled and courageous Israelis and Palestinians working together to this goal. The locus of their work is in Jerusalem and the West Bank and not Gaza or Sderot. Our objective was to see and understand the circumstances within which they operate.</p>
<p>Krein clearly cares deeply about the future of Israel. He would therefore do well to heed the concerns raised by members of the group. While he might not agree with all we say, when 23 diverse and experienced South Africans raise serious worries about Israeli human rights abuses perpetrated on the West Bank, we suggest it is worth considering whether there is some merit in our claims. We are hardly the first to make these criticisms. It need hardly be added that we too care about Israel and Palestine. We also care about Muslim and Jewish relations in South Africa, which are imperilled by differences over the middle-east. It is in the spirit of making a very small difference toward improving these conflicts that we participated in the tour and commented on what we saw.</p>
